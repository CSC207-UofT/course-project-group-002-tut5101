Supply branch (can be merged with delivery services?): manager can manage the type and quantity of raw materials needed per day and per week (some materials need to be updated daily and some weekly).

I mean, we may have a class named menu that tracks the dishes on the menu and manager may modify the menu to add or remove dishes and set the prices)

Deliver services—takeaway people can see the order’s destination, time, dishes, additional requirements, estimated time of arrival.
