# Progress Report
## Summary of Specification
## CRC Model
## Scenario Walk-through
## Open Questions
## Designs that have worked well
- The change from our original design of OrderList and KitchenStaff to only Kitchen with three queue attributes 
simplify the ordering -> food processing -> food serving / delivering process a lot. It also makes the purpose of each 
attribute very clear and easy to comprehend.

## Summary of Subgroup Progress
### Design
Our group of three (Dedong, Evelyn, and Raymond) on the design of classes of Staff, ServingStaff, DeliveryStaff, 
InventoryStaff, PlacedOrderQueue, Order, Kitchen, and RestaurantInfo.

Designed CRC cards of the above classes by our group.

Discussed mechanism of Kitchen class of our group.
### Coding

Implemented following classes:

- Staff: the parent class of all kinds of staff
  - ServingStaff: subclass of Staff, a staff that sends dishes to tables
  - DeliveryStaff: subclass of Staff, a staff that sends orders for takeout orders
  - InventoryStaff
- PlacedOrderQueue: A queue to hold the orders by customers for Kitchen to process
- Order: A class that holds a list of dishes ordered by a customer, the current status of the order,
and the table number/destination of the order. Can return the total price of dishes in the order.
- Kitchen: A class that gets new orders from an instance of PlaceOrderQueue, updates the status of the dishes in the 
order, and depending on the type of the order, add the dish / order to the queues for either delivery staff or serving 
staff to access.
- RestaurantInfo: A class that holds all the information about this restaurant (e.g. name, address, staffs, capacity).

### Testing
Created at least one test for all the methods in all the classes we wrote as described in the coding part.
