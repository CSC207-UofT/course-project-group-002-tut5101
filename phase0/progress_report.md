# Progress Report
## Summary of Specification
This is a restaurant application for a specific restaurant in order to manage the staff and inventory conveniently and
incorporate the traditional service with digital platforms to facilitate the customers' experience. The specific users
include personnel in a restaurant and customers. The users would get their required information faster and easier than
before.
## Summary of CRC Model
We designed the CRC model according to its description and functionality.
We decided that entities in the clean architecture, which are objects that embodies a small set of
Critical Business Rules operating on Critical Business Data, includes User(an abstract class that is the superclass
for Customer, Manager and Staff), Staff(a superclass for ServingStaff, InventoryStaff, DeliveryStaff, Kitchen,
), Order, Dish, DishList,  RestaurantInfo, Inventory(which is an abstract class and superclass for Product and Material),
Product(which is an abstract class and superclass for Alcohol, SemiFinished, and SoftDrink), SoftDrink, Alcohol, SemiFinished,
Material(which is an abstract class and superclass for Meat,Seafood,Seasoner,VegeFruit,Grain,DairySoy), Meat, Seafood,
Seasoner, Vegefruit, Grain and DairySoy. We decided that use cases in the clean architecture, which is a description of
the way that an automated system affect Entities, includes InventoryList, Review, OrderHistory, PlaceOrderQueue, Kitchen,
DeliveryStaff, ServingStaff, InventoryStaff, Manager and Customer.
We labeled the inheritance relationships between classes and their collaboration and responsibilities, and whether they
are abstract.
We modified our CRC model several times during coding to fit our program.

## Summary of Scenario Walk-through
A dine-in customer ordered dishes and some dishes cannot be made because of lacking ingredients and the cookable 
dishes were served after finish.
## Open Questions
- Struggling on the exact implementation of InventoryList. Considering for the staffs involved in this scenario required
only freshness and quantity, the final decision is hard to made between a single hashmap like structure or two hashmap 
like structures which are easier to use but hard to add more features in the future.
- 
## Designs that have worked well
- The change from our original design of OrderList and KitchenStaff to only Kitchen with three queue attributes 
simplify the ordering -> food processing -> food serving / delivering process a lot. It also makes the purpose of each 
attribute very clear and easy to comprehend.
- The previous idea of creating simply hashmap of name-freshness and name-quantity was change to a specific class 
InventoryList, which protect the internal information in a hashmap.

## Summary of Subgroup1 Progress
### Design
Our group of three (Dedong, Evelyn, and Raymond) on the design of classes of Staff, ServingStaff, DeliveryStaff, 
InventoryStaff, PlacedOrderQueue, Order, Kitchen, and RestaurantInfo.

Designed CRC cards of the above classes by our group.

Discussed mechanism of Kitchen class of our group.
### Coding

Implemented following classes:

- Staff: the parent class of all kinds of staff
  - ServingStaff: subclass of Staff, a staff that sends dishes to tables
  - DeliveryStaff: subclass of Staff, a staff that sends orders for takeout orders
  - InventoryStaff
- PlacedOrderQueue: A queue to hold the orders by customers for Kitchen to process
- Order: A class that holds a list of dishes ordered by a customer, the current status of the order,
and the table number/destination of the order. Can return the total price of dishes in the order.
- Kitchen: A class that gets new orders from an instance of PlaceOrderQueue, updates the status of the dishes in the 
order, and depending on the type of the order, add the dish / order to the queues for either delivery staff or serving 
staff to access.
- RestaurantInfo: A class that holds all the information about this restaurant (e.g. name, address, staffs, capacity).

### Testing
Created at least one test for all the methods in all the classes we wrote as described in the coding part.

## Summary of subgroup2 Progress

### General information

Our group have 2 people, Chan Yu and Naihe Xiao. We worked on the design of the User class(which is the
super class for Customer, Manager, Staff and child classes of Staff), Customer class, Manager class, 
UserList class, Dish class and DishList class. We included comments for each class and its methods.

We worked on the CRC cards of the classes included above.

We also included the basic progress for a customer to login to his or her account in the RestaurantSystem
class, which is the class we are intending to use as our main operating class in our program.

### Coding of each class

- User: the parent class of all users of the program(app). This includes Customer, Manager, Staff, Kitchen, ServingStaff,
InventoryStaff and DeliveryStaff. A User has a unique id, a username, password, address, gender, phone and email 
information.
  - Customer: a child class of User that stores information about a customer. It has an overridden toString method that returns the string representation of the specific information of
a customer. A Customer can log in to its account with his or hers id and password, where he or she can see the menu,
and make an order. A Customer can also leave an anonymous comment, or a complaint to a particular serving staff. 
  - Manager: a child class of User that stores information about the manager. It is one of the most important classes in 
our program, and a Manager is able to manipulate the prices of dishes, payment of staffs, inventories list and so on.

- UserList: a public class storing all user information using a HashMap, mapping each userid to a User. It can add and 
remove Users, and find the information of a user or modify a specific attribute of a User.
- Dish: a public class storing basic information of a Dish, including its name, price, ingredients, calories, features like 
recommended or not, allergy information and status of preparation. It contains getter and setter methods for each 
attribute, and has an overridden toString method that returns the string representation of the specific information of 
a dish.
- DishList: a public class storing all dish information using an ArrayList. It has a generateDishList method that can generate
an ArrayList of dishes. It is used by the manager to adjust the prices of dishes according to the number of times a dish
is ordered according to the information stored in OrderHistory class.

We also added specific descriptions of each class and their methods as comments.

### Testing

We also wrote at least an unittest for each class, and an unittest for each method, both overridden and overloading ones.
We left comments including descriptions and responsibilities of each unittest class.


## Summary of subgroup3 Progress

### General information

Our group have 2 people, Mingyang Li and Shaojie Dong. We worked on the design of the Inventory class(which is the
super class for Product class and Material class), Product class, Material class,
their child classes which can be made as instance, InventoryList class and Review. 
We included comments for each class and its methods.

We worked on the CRC cards of the classes included above.


### Coding of each class

- Inventory: the parent abstract class of Product and Material class, whose quantity and used up status can be checked
   and changed by methods.
  - Product: a child abstract class of Inventory whose expiry date can be checked.
    - Alcohol, Semifinished, SoftDrink: Sub class of Product which can be instantiated. 
  - Material: a child abstract class of Inventory whose freshness can be checked and changed.

- InventoryList: a class that contains inventory items. Certain information can be checked or set by its name.
- Review: a class that represent the review of customers
We also added specific descriptions of each class and their methods as comments.

### Testing

Creating unit test for InventoryList class, Product class ,Material class and Review.
