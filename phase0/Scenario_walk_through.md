## Scenario Walkthrough
A dine-in UseCase.Customer checks the menu, which obtains a list of dishes and their prices from DishList. When the UseCase.Customer
places an entities.Order on PlaceOrderQueue, if the Inventory lacks ingredients to make a entities.Dish, then the order is rejected.
Otherwise, the total price is calculated and returned to the UseCase.Customer.

The kitchen will repeatedly ask for orders to cook, when they finish a dish, they update the ingredient quantity in
the inventory, and they check if this dish belongs to a delivery order or a dine-in order. If dine-in order, then add
a tuple of table number and dish to a queue for the serving staff. Serving staff repeatedly check if there is any
dish to be served, if yes, they pop the dish and serve it.
