A dine-in use_case.Customer checks the DishList from the RestaurantSystem, which obtains a list of dishes and their prices from DishList. When the use_case.Customer
places an entity.Order on PlaceOrderQueue, the total price is calculated and returned to the Customer.

the inventory, and they check if this dish belongs to a delivery order or a dine-in order. If dine-in order, then add
a tuple of table number and dish to a queue for the serving staff. Serving staff repeatedly check if there is any
dish to be served, if yes, they pop the dish and serve it.
